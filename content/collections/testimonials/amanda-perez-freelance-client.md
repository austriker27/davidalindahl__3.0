I cannot say enough great things about David. I first approached David two years ago to help build a custom website to showcase my portfolio. As a design professional, I had some pretty lofty visions and ideas. David not only accepted my demands, he told me he'd build custom CMS website so that I could add, edit and change content to my liking for years to come. He was timely in his delivery, communicative in his process, and readily available for any questions or concerns I had along the way and after launch. Working with David was an enjoyable and collaborative experience and the product he delivered met all of my expectations. To this day I continue to partner with David on projects. I 10/10 would recommend!
