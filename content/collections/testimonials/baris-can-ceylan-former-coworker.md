David and I collaborated on multiple projects together at our time in Indigo Slate, and it was a pleasure working together. Apart from his great developer skills and attention to detail, I would like to point out his two noteworthy qualities.

One, his ability to canvass the requirements of a project, and finding the best tools for it. If there is a better tool or practice for the task, he will find it. He's not afraid of leaving his the comfort zone to learn new technologies. Most recently, David introduced Tailwind CSS to our team, to solve pain points and development issues, resulted in better development experience.

Second, he's a great communicator and doesn't leave any unanswered questions or ambiguity, making sure all requirements are addressed with the best solutions. It is always enjoyable and eye-opening discussing with him.
