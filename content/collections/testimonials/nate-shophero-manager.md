David was an absolute joy to work with. His positive, proactive, energetic approach to programming and teamwork were contagious and lifted the team spirit and productivity from day one. He is knowledgeable in a wide variety of technologies and easily and quickly learns the ones he's not familiar with. He was a critical part of a 3-member team that delivered the front-end Vue.js application for our eCommerce platform. Couldn't have done it without him. Would hire 10 out of 10 times. He's simply fantastic!!!David was an absolute joy to work with.
