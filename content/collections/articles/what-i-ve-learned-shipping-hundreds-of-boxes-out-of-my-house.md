          Get a label printer. Like yesterday. If you are printing even several times a month I think it's a worthwhile investment. I have [this Rollo thermal printer](https://www.rollo.com/product/rollo-printer/) thanks to Rami ([check out his epic sock company!](https://www.ftgusocks.com/)) that I love. Because it's a thermal printer it doesn't use or ever need ink replaced. Woohoo! The Rollo is easy to setup and easy to use. Definitely worth the $200ish investment. 
          
          Also important to this process is a scale (and measuring tape) so you can calculate the exact size and weight of your packages. There's dozens of options on amazon, just search for "shipping or mail scale". Whatever shipping platform you use will ask for it and unless you are shipping heavy things a flat box isn't a cost effective approach.

        markdown: 'Chances are if you are running an ecommerce business you are using Etsy or Shopify or Woocommerce. And in that case you are already getting commercial shipping rates (woohoo!). But of you are still paying normal rates for USPS shipping then here''s a secret: you don''t have to be! There''s a lot of platforms like [ShipStation](https://www.shipstation.com/) and [Shippo](https://goshippo.com/) that offer a lot of services in addition to commercial shipping rates. (I prefer Shippo because it''s user interface is better). So if you are shipping a lot and not getting those commercial rates that save you $1-3 per package check them out. If you aren''t shipping enough to pay for a monthly service or aren''t running an ecommerce business then you need to be using [PirateShip](https://www.pirateship.com/)! Its free and is a great way to save money per shipment. Another alternative is [Sendle](https://www.sendle.com/) although I''ve found PirateShip to be slightly cheaper. '

          I was using USPS supplies (the flat rate boxes and regional boxes which you can get for free) before migrating to [Eco Enclose](https://www.ecoenclose.com/). And I wish I'd done it sooner. Eco Enclose has a plethora of amazing, super earth friendly shipping supplies and materials for any needs you have. 
          
          My favorite products are their custom boxes for my shipments, a custom designed card for including in the boxes, and their zero waste labels! I use the custom boxes for an exact fit on my products which allows me to save money on shipping so I think they are worth it. 
          
          Seriously go check them out and earth will thank you!

          I don't remember the last time I went to the USPS store to wait in their never ending line to ship a package. Here's a little known secret: Did you know USPS can pickup packages from your home? Its super easy to schedule a pickup so you don't even have to leave the house! [Go here and schedule a pickup](https://tools.usps.com/schedule-pickup-steps.htm). 
          
          Only caveat is that it must be the night before, which has caught me a few times. Once I started using this free service, I never went back and you won't either!
