          The analytics for this website are open. Anyone can peruse them. And I've chosen to remove Google Analytics due to privacy concerns and go with the privacy focused platform Fathom Analytics. I highly recommend their platform. [Try them out and save $10 with my link](https://usefathom.com/ref/SIUVYE)!

          If that beautiful dashboard doesn't have you convinced, here's the other reasons why I love Fathom from the mouth of the ~~horse~~ errr Fathom.
          
          - You don't need to display those pesky cookie notices as we don't use cookies, nor do we track invasive data.
          - We offer simple, straight-forward website analytics.
          - We are focused on privacy for website visitors, we don't track them, save their personal information, or need it to be profitable.
          - We have hundreds of customers and track tens of millions of page views per month, so we may be a small company, but we're doing big things.
          - We can handle viral content without breaking a sweat, so your site won't slow down because of us, and we don't ever stop tracking you because of a spike in popularity.
          - We've been featured in Fast Company as a great alternative to Google Analytics.
          - All of our plans allow for unlimited websites to be tracked and receive our top-notch customer support.
