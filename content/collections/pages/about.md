          I'm a web developer // dad // human // husband // puppy owner // photographer // entrepeneur // jesus lover // liverpool fc fan // footy lover // seinfeld watcher

          As a Front End Developer I'm currently seeking new opportunities after several years at Indigo Slate (an award winning Ad Agency in Seattle) and Zaengle Corp (A software engineering firm with a mission to Do Good, Be Nice). I love being at the intersection of design and development where I can flex my left and right side of the brain.

          ## In the past I've done work for:
          - Sony's Alpha Universe
          - Microsoft
          - Small businesses
          - SAP Concur
          - The Ad Council
          - Hotfusion

          I'm also a photographer, for more on that check out my [photography portfolio](https://davidlindahlphoto.com/).
