  Howdy! ðŸ‘‹ <br><br>
  
  My name is David and I'm a frontend/UI developer by day and e-commerce entrepeneur running RainierWatch.com by night. <br><br>
  
  
  In the past I've used tools like Vue.js, React, Gridsome, Nuxt.js, and even, yes, jQuery, to make epic things for clients like Sony, Microsoft, and SAP Concur. At the end of the day, I love crafting intuitive digital solutions for compelling brands and creating beautiful user experiences that surprise and delight end users. Also you should know being a child of the 80s, I'm embarassingly obsessed with all things throwback design (queue the synthwave music ðŸ‘¾) and love designing new old school looking gear for Rainier Watch.

Howdy! ðŸ‘‹

My name is David and I'm a frontend/UI developer and design lover. In the past I've used tools like Vue.js, React, Gridsome, Nuxt.js, and even, yes, jQuery, to make epic things for clients. At the end of the day, I love crafting intuitive digital solutions for compelling brands and creating beautiful user experiences that surprise and delight end users. Also you should know being a child of the 80s, I'm embarassingly obsessed with all things 80s design (queue the synthwave music ðŸ‘¾) and as an e-commerce entrepreneur founder you can often find me dreaming up new apparel designs for rainierwatch.com.
