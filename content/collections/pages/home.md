  Howdy! ðŸ‘‹ <br><br>

  My name is David and I'm a frontend/UI developer by day and ecommerce entrepreneur running [Rainier Watch](https://rainierwatch.com) by night. <br>
  I love bringing ideas to life for people just like you. It's somewhat of a passion of mine, dating back to 2013 when I started tweeting as Rainier Watch when The Mountain was out. Since then I've grown a social media following to over 50,000. Then in 2018 I started the RW Shop and since generated over $100,000 in sales and have donated over $7,000. <br>
  I've built 20+ websites for clients and worked on internal revenue generating products at prior agencies. I've built websites used by hundreds, thousands, and even millions of people. <br>
  In the past I've used various web tools like Vue.js, CMSes like Statamic and Craft, HTML/CSS, Tailwind CSS, Alpine.JS, and even, yes, jQuery, to make epic digital solutions for clients like Sony, the Ad Council, Laravel News, Microsoft, and SAP Concur. At the end of the day, I love crafting intuitive digital solutions for compelling brands and creating beautiful user experiences that surprise and delight end users. Also you should know being a child of the 80s, I'm embarrassingly obsessed with all things throwback design (queue the synthwave music ðŸ‘¾) and love designing new apparel for for my aforementioned side project, Rainier Watch.

My name is David and I'm a frontend/UI developer and design lover. In the past I've used tools like Vue.js, React, Gridsome, Nuxt.js, and even, yes, jQuery, to make epic things for clients. At the end of the day, I love crafting intuitive digital solutions for compelling brands and creating beautiful user experiences that surprise and delight end users. Also you should know being a child of the 80s, I'm embarassingly obsessed with all things 80s design (queue the synthwave music ðŸ‘¾) and as an e-commerce entrepreneur founder you can often find me dreaming up new apparel designs for rainierwatch.com.
