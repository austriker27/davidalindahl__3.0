          Here's what I'm using these days: 
          
          ## Developer Life
          
          ### Editor + Terminal + Coding
          
          - VS Code
          - Synthwave theme
          - Hyper or iTerm depending on the day
          - macOS
          - My daily browser is Firefox because its super rad and for debugging I use Firefox Developer Edition or Chrome
          - Font of choice for coding: Dank Mono
          - CMS of choice: Statamic
          - CSS of choice: TailwindCSS
          - Vue.js or Nuxt.js or Gridsome (aka Vue across the board)
          
          ### Servers and stuff
          
          - I try to avoid server management as much as I can because it makes my blood boil.
          - For WordPress I've loved [Flywheel](http://rnwt.ch/flywheel)
          - For cheap shared hosting and domains with free privacy I've used [DreamHost](http://dlndl.co/dh) for years without complaint
          - [Cloudinary](http://dlndl.co/cloudinary) makes responsive image hosting super easy because #perfmatters
          
          
          ## The Office
          
          ### Apps I couldnt live without
          
          - [1Password](http://dlndl.co/1pw) is the greatest thing since melted butter.
          - ProtonVPN keeps my internet traffic secure, which is super important when on public wifi.
          - For dev projects [Basecamp Personal](https://basecamp.com/personal) is the coolest thing ever
          
          ### Freelancing
          - [Harvest](http://dlndl.co/harvest) for time tracking
          - [Dropbox](http://dlndl.co/dropbox) makes cloud storge easy
          - [Woven](http://dlndl.co/woven) is amazing for scheduling meetings. I can just generate a link for folks to grab time off my calendar
          - I organize nearly everything on kanbans via [Trello](http://dlndl.co/trello) but am worried their Atlassian overlords will kill it. Bigger things go into Basecamp Personal
          
          ### Desktop Setup
          
          - MacBook Pro (Retina, 15-inch, Mid 2014) - 2.5 GHz Intel Core i7 - 16GB DDR3 RAM - 500GB SSD HD
          - My desk is the Uplift with white legs
          - My mech keyboard that I love is a [Keychron 2](http://dlndl.co/keychron)
          - My laptop is perfectly positioned via the iLevel Rain Design Stand
          
          ### Desktop Apps
          
          - For quick screenshots and videos I use [CloudApp](http://dlndl.co/cloudapp)
          - I use [the hand mirror app](https://handmirror.app/) to make sure I'm not totally hideous when I show up at video meetings
          - Sipp.app is an amazing little app for grabbing and storing color palettes
          - [CopyClip](https://fiplab.com/apps/copyclip-for-mac) is a life saver because it stores the gazillion copies that I do. It will change your workflow.
          - Magnet is how I manage all my windows
          
          ## Photography
          
          ### Mobile Photos
          
          - Currently I do a lot of mobile photography with my [Moment gear](http://dlndl.co/moment)
           - Moment Anamorphic Lense
           - Moment Wide Angle Lense
           - Moment Telephoto Lense
           - Moment Fisheye Lense
          
          
          ### Non Mobile Photography
          
          - [Peak Designs Everyday 30L Backpack](https://www.peakdesign.com/products/everyday-backpack)
          - My DSLR for paid gigs and weddings is a Nikon D750

          ## Financials
          
          Yes I'm a huge financial/budget nerd. Lots more coming here soon.
          
          ### Stock Trading
          
          - Occasional stock trades via [Robinhood](http://dlndl.co/robinhood)
          - Long term savings and investing done via the amazing [WealthFront (use this link to get money managed for free](http://dlndl.co/wlthfrt)
          - Most of my other investments are held by Fidelity
