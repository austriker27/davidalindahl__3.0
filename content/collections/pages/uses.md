          Here's what I'm using these days:

          ## Developer Life

          ### Editor + Terminal + Coding

          - VS Code
          - Synthwave theme
          - Hyper or iTerm depending on the day
          - macOS
          - My daily browser is Firefox because its super rad and for debugging I use Firefox Developer Edition or Chrome
          - Font of choice for coding: Dank Mono
          - CMS of choice: Statamic (or Craft CMS when the build is big and super complex and/or needs a database)
          - CSS of choice: Tailwind CSS
          - Vue.js or Nuxt.js or Gridsome (aka Vue across the board)

          ### Servers and stuff

          - I try to avoid server management as much as I can because it makes my blood boil.
          - For WordPress I've loved [Flywheel](http://rnwt.ch/flywheel)
          - For cheap shared hosting and domains with free privacy I've used [DreamHost](http://dlndl.co/dh) for years without complaint
          - For Statamic and sites were continuous deployment is helpful, Ploi is my goto deployment platform (usually on a [DigitalOcean](https://dlndl.co/digitalocean) server because they are sooo good)
          - [Cloudinary](http://dlndl.co/cloudinary) and [Imagekit](https://dlndl.co/imagekit) are both amazing for making images and media handling easier and better. because #perfmatters


          ## The Office

          ### Apps I couldnt live without

          - [1Password](http://dlndl.co/1pw) is the greatest thing since melted butter.
          - ProtonVPN keeps my internet traffic secure, which is super important when on public wifi.
          - For dev projects [Basecamp Personal](https://basecamp.com/personal) is the coolest thing ever

          ### Freelancing
          - [Harvest](http://dlndl.co/harvest) for time tracking
          - [Dropbox](http://dlndl.co/dropbox) makes cloud storge easy
          - ~[Woven](http://dlndl.co/woven) is amazing for scheduling meetings. I can just generate a link for folks to grab time off my calendar~ RIP Woven...
          - ~I organize nearly everything on kanbans via [Trello](http://dlndl.co/trello) but am worried their Atlassian overlords will kill it. Bigger things go into Basecamp Personal~ JK, since 2020 I moved on from Trello and on to Notion (it has a high learning curve but is oh so powerful)

          ### Desktop Setup

          - MacBook Pro (Retina, 15-inch, Mid 2014) - 2.5 GHz Intel Core i7 - 16GB DDR3 RAM - 500GB SSD HD
          - My desk is the Uplift with white legs
          - My mech keyboard that I love is a [Keychron 2](http://dlndl.co/keychron)
          - My laptop is perfectly positioned via the iLevel Rain Design Stand

          ### Desktop Apps

          - For quick screenshots and videos I use [CloudApp](http://dlndl.co/cloudapp)
          - I use [the hand mirror app](https://handmirror.app/) to make sure I'm not totally hideous when I show up at video meetings
          - Sipp.app is an amazing little app for grabbing and storing color palettes
          - [CopyClip](https://fiplab.com/apps/copyclip-for-mac) is a life saver because it stores the gazillion copies that I do. It will change your workflow.
          - Magnet is how I manage all my windows

          ## Photography

          ### Mobile Photos

          - Currently I do a lot of mobile photography with my [Moment gear](http://dlndl.co/moment)
           - Moment Anamorphic Lense
           - Moment Wide Angle Lense
           - Moment Telephoto Lense

          ### Non Mobile Photography

          ## Financials

          Yes I'm a huge financial/budget nerd. I want to create a series of blogs about investing, personal finance and more! So stay tuned for more. For now, [check out the blog](/wrote/my-automated-approach-to-budgeting-and-saving) I wrote about our budget. (tl;dr I [use Wealthfront](https://dlndl.co/wlthfrt) to automate our savings)

          ### Stock Trading
